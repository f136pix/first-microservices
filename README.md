##  Dotnet Microservices with PHP Integration

This project builds upon [this Les Jackson's course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgVjEo3OGBI) on creating and deploying Dotnet microservices with K8S, RabbitMQ and NGINX. 
I extended it incorporating a new message queue and a Laravel deployment that captures and logs the values.
